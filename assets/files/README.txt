                        HackGBGay Badge 2025

                       https://hack.gbgay.com

This is the badge for the HackGBGay event of 2025.

Flags are codes that can be found by solving the various available challenges.
They always* start with the text "gbgay{" and end with "}". The text inbetween
the curly braces is unique for each challenge. If you find one you can enter
it by selecting "Code Entry" in the main menu, and using the little on-screen
keyboard to enter in the text.

The microcontroller on the badge is a Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, featuring two
ARM Cortex-M0+ cores, a 125 MHz system clock, 256 KiB of core RAM, and 16 MiB
of external FLASH memory.

When plugged into a computer, the badge will present as a USB drive containing
this file, and also as a USB COM port with debug text output.

The firmware sources and assets for the badge, including this file and others,
will be available on GitHub. Because the sources might include some of the
flags, the repository is private until after the event.

* The exception to the rule is that there are two short codes hidden on the
  badge PCB itself, which due to space constraints do not include the leading
  "gbgay{" or trailing "}".
