This is the badge for the HackGBGay event of 2025. Aside from this USB drive,
the badge also presents a USB COM port with a Python REPL for interacting with
the badge.

The firmware sources for the badge, including this file and others, will be
available on GitHub. Because the sources might include some of the flags, the
repository is private until after the event.
