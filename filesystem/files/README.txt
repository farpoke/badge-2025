This is the badge for the HackGBGay event of 2025.

The microcontroller on the badge is a Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, featuring two
ARM Cortex-M0+ cores, 125 MHz system clock, 256 KiB of core RAM, and an
additional 16 MiB of external FLASH memory.

Aside from this USB drive, the badge also presents a USB COM port with a Python
REPL that can be used to interact with the badge.

The firmware sources and assets for the badge, including this file and others,
will be available on GitHub. Because the sources might include some of the
flags, the repository is private until after the event.
